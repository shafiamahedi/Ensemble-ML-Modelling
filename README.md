# Ensemble-ML-Modelling
## For the given Dataset , find the best classification algorithm.
Problem Statement : Take up three classification algorithms of your own choice and build three respective Machine learning models. Compare the Accuracy of all three and suggest which ML algorithms suits best for the given problem.

### The Repository consists of a .ipynb file and a pdf file (report) along with the dataset.
#### The Classificaton Algorithms used are :
> 1. Random Forest <br>
> 2. Naive Bayes<br>
> 3. SVM
#### The following features have been implemented in the project :
> 1)  Exploratory data analysis (with visualization) and Data Cleaning if required
> 2) Questions asked on dataset and answers for the same with brief explanation  
> 3) Feature Selection and feature Engineering if required depending on the dataset
> 4) Ensemble Machine learning Modelling (3 Classification Algorithms)
> 5) Accuracy calculation 
> 6) Summarised write up at the end
